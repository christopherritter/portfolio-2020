      Hello! I’m Aleksi Tappura, a freelance designer focused on digital product
      design. I collaborate with passionate people and companies to create
      products and services that have exceptional user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in working directly with the end-user from the beginning, to
      create solutions that are genuinely desirable, feasible and viable for the
      business and the users. In practice, this means a lot of experiments,
      prototypes and stakeholder interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently available for new projects, so send me a message and let’s
      discuss how I can help you. I’m open to work both on-site in Helsinki, or
      remotely.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also follow me on Twitter, Dribbble, LinkedIn, or reach out via
      email - hello@aleksitappura.com.
